//Real-Time Cleanliness & Toilet Status Tracker
Problem: Passengers don’t know which toilet is usable/clean.
an app is made where passenger can enter train number and can see whether the toilet 
present in the train is occupied or not. There will be cleaning button infront of the
door of the washroom and a sensor will be attached to it which will detect whether 
the toilet is vacant or occupied. If the door is locked from inside then it will show 
occupied and if it is opened then it will show vacant. If the passenger want to enter 
the washroom and find it dirty then he can press the cleaning button and the cleaning
will be done through sensor, motor and valve. passenger can't press it when the door 
is locked and also when the cleaning is in progress. You cant press the button within 
30seconds of the previous press. 

How will people get access in train without internet?
